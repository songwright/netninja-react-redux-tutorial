The Net Ninja creates an index.html file with links to two React CDN’s (content delivery network). Using CDN’s helps you get started faster. He also creates a div with the id of “app” which will be controlled with a React component.

He opens the extensions in Visual Studio Code to show two extensions that he will use, ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets and Sublime Babel. ES7 React snippets gives you snippets of code to use as shortcuts. Sublime Babel helps give you syntax highlighting for when you write JSX for components so that it looks like HTML.
