The Net Ninja demonstrates React Developer Tools, which are available as a Chrome extension, available in the chrome web store at this link:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi

Once installed, the React dev tools extension will put an icon in the top right corner of the page that will allow you to use the React dev tools. The React icon will be red if the React page is in development. If the page is in production, the icon will be blue and black. The extension will put a React tab in dev tools that will show the React component in the Elements pane and the props and state in the other pane. The values of the state can be changed, so 35 can be changed to 55 here. In reality, the user would change the state through the user interface. The reactjs.org page uses React. The Net Ninja shows that you can use the ui in this page to change values in a component in React dev tools, just as change the state values in the dev tools changes the same values on the page.

Note: Facebook has hidden React from this extension, so you can’t look at their components.
